What is Machine Learning?

???

A field of AI that enables systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

---

What's the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?

???

Supervised learning uses labeled data to make predictions, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data.

---

What is overfitting?

???

When a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, making it perform poorly on new, unseen data.

---

What is gradient descent?

???

An optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts model parameters to minimize errors by moving in the direction that reduces the error the most.

---

What's the difference between classification and regression?

???

Classification predicts discrete categories (like spam/not spam), while regression predicts continuous values (like house prices).

---

What is cross-validation?

???

A technique to assess model performance by splitting data into multiple training and testing sets, ensuring reliable evaluation.

---

What is feature engineering?

???

The process of selecting, creating, or transforming input variables to make them more useful for machine learning models.

---

What is ensemble learning?

???

Combining multiple models to create a stronger model, like using multiple decision trees to create a random forest.

---

What is deep learning?

???

A subset of machine learning using neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of data.

---

What is bias-variance tradeoff?

???

The balance between a model being too simple (high bias) and too complex (high variance).

---

What is regularization?

???

A technique to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term that discourages complex models.

---

What is a neural network?

???

A computing system inspired by biological brains, using layers of connected nodes to process and learn from data.

---

What is transfer learning?

???

Using a pre-trained model on a new but related task, saving time and resources compared to training from scratch.

---

What is reinforcement learning?

???

A type of learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards/penalties.

---

What is batch normalization?

???

A technique that normalizes the input of each layer to speed up training and improve model stability.

---

What is dropout?

???

A regularization technique that randomly deactivates neurons during training to prevent overfitting.

---

What is a confusion matrix?

???

A table showing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives to evaluate classification performance.

---

What is the difference between bagging and boosting?

???

Bagging trains models in parallel on random subsets of data, while boosting trains models sequentially, focusing on previously misclassified examples.

---

What is K-means clustering?

???

An unsupervised algorithm that groups similar data points into K clusters based on their distances from cluster centers.

---

What is dimensionality reduction?

???

Techniques to reduce the number of input features while preserving important information, making models simpler and more efficient.
